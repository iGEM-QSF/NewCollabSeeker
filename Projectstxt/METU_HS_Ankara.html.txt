Colon cancer is a widespread disease which is the forth most common cancer throughout the
world. It is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death
in men and women combined in the United States. Furthermore, in Turkey 7 in 100,000 is suffering
from colon cancer and each year 3200 people die. In colon cancer, polyp formation is observerd.
They are the growth tissues in colon’s inner surface. Polyps are benign (non-cancerous) growths, but
cancer can start in some types of them; like Adenomatous polyps. They are the only type of polyp
that can turn in to a colorectal cancer cell. We searched about some tumor suppressor genes and
proteins. We saw that their arrangements are too long to use in E.coli. At that point, we found that
butric acid is more appropriate for us. We researched again and found a substance called butyrate.
Butyrate is a short chain fatty acid which is formed by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates.
Considering it’s positive effects on colon cancer, we decided to choose butyrate as our remedy for
colon cancer. After, our bacteria sticks to the cancerous cells in colon flora, it will secrete butyrate
which induces apoptosis and differentiation and also inhibits proliferation. We use RPMrel and FimH
in order to provide our bacteria to stick to cancer cells with the help of its pili. Last year, Team Harvard 2015 developed a pathway for E.coli to bind to cancerous cells in colon. They used a pathogenic E.coli. Pathogenic E.coli has a structure called “pilli”. They are attached two adapter proteins FimF and FimG, and FimH adhesin at the and of the pillus. Then, they inserted a binding peptide called RPMrel into the FimH protein to achieve specificity. This year, we will take their project to the next step; treatment. Our E.coli will bind to the cancerous cell and after binding it will start producing butyrate, which will induce apoptosis in the cancerous cell
