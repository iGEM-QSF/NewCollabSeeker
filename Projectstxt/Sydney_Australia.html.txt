Have you ever packed a banana for lunch but forgotten about it, later finding that it has coated your bag with a sticky, mushy mess? Have you ever ventured into the supermarket to seek out that perfect avocado, squeezing countless candidates but finding none that make the cut?Ethylene is the major hormone involved in plant ripening, and this has led to it's regulation being crucial to the agricultural industry. Premature ripening has resulted in large losses in the agricultural industry. However, it is currently difficult to efficiently and cost-effectively measure the levels of this elusive gaseous hormone.  This year, the University of Sydney iGEM team will develop a portable, convenient and cost-effective biosensor to measure ethylene concentrations in all sorts of situations.
Current ethylene detection methods for regulating ripening rates include gas chromatography, electrochemical or optical sensors, or simply dispensing a set volume of ethylene gas into a sealed fruit room. Alternatively, ripeness is monitored by inspecting colour or firmness of the fruit. These existing methods are generally expensive, inconvenient, or involve direct contact with the fruit. By creating a cell-based biosensor, iGEM Sydney aims to create the foundation for a safe, reliable method of ethylene detection which will minimize global losses due to fruit spoilage. This can potentially be translated to a cell-free, paper based biosensor which can take the form of a fruit sticker, immediately displaying the ripeness of the fruit.
