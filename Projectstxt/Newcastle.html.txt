Electronic engineering has given us the television and the mobile phone, while genetic engineering has afforded us mass-scale antimalarial drugs, biofuels and an enormous range of biosensors.

More than a decade ago, Tom Knight and colleagues envisioned using 'BioBricks' to standardise synthetic biological parts. Here at Newcastle we want to return to iGEM's humble origins and come full circle. We are currently working on replacing traditional electronic components with biological alternatives. Building a series of new compatible bacterial components, we can mix and match to create electro-biological components within a breadboard.

This merging of biology and computer science holds fantastic opportunities for education, and we are looking forward to working with school children to develop and incrementally improve our project.
