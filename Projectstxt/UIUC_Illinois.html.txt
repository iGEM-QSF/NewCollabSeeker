 Promoters can be used to control the gene expression of whichever gene they are placed upstream of. Most promoters which are currently in the iGEM registry can be separated into one of two categories. There are constitutive, or “always on,” promoters of various strengths. There are also inducible promoters, which activate transcription based environmental factors such as light, pH, or the presence of any number of molecules. 

For our project, UIUC_Illinois is characterizing a promoter library that will give users more control over gene expression, without the need for inducers. We are currently working to isolate a set of e. coli promoters that turn on and off according to the host’s growth phase. For example, one promoter may become active during exponential growth but shut off once stationary phase is reached. Another promoter may be active only during the initial lag phase before shutting off for the rest of the growth curve. It is our hope that these promoters will be useful tools for any teams wishing to time protein production in vivo, whether the intended applications are metabolic engineering, probiotics, or any number of related topics.
