Fractos: Endolysin-powered antimicrobial system for selective lysis of Acinetobacter baumannii
iGEM TecCEM 2016 team, first gathered on 5th of December 2015, decided that a quite important problem affecting hospital throughout the world was the uprising antibiotic resistance. While carefully analysing statistics on the metropolitan area within and surrounding Mexico City, Acinetobacter baumannii was chosen as the prime target of our project development. Acinetobacter baumannii is a pathogenic and opportunistic bacterium responsible for infections in hospital environments, mainly amongst patients at ICUs. Nowadays, it has drawn major attention given its ability to acquire resistance to commonly used antimicrobial agents. Due to the widely spread resistant mechanisms among
microorganisms, antibiotics have lost their efficiency at annihilating pathogens, up to the point of being non-efficient at all in the treatment of certain infections. 

After several weeks of research concerning the bacterium, its genetic and microbiological properties, and the pathophysiology it follows for infecting humans, we decided to aim the development of 2016 project into generating a novel mechanism for its elimination from hospital environments. This year iGEM TecCEM 2016 team is developing a novel and specific method to avoid Acinetobacter baumannii proliferation onto nonliving surfaces, through cell wall lysis, as an alternative to currently used antimicrobials that promote the development of antimicrobial resistance. The use of endolysins ensures the elimination of the pathogen of interest, as specificity for Acinetobacter baumannii increases its efficiency. The purpose of formulating a disinfectant driven by such endolysins is the sanitization of surgery and nursery equipment as well as room furnishing, and
other objects that are potential transmission vectors for Acinetobacter baumannii.
