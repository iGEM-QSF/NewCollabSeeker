Synthetic biology has been developed for decades and many useful as well as mature principle in engineer disciplines are applied in designing, building and testing synthetic parts, devices or systems. However, it still remains difficulty and complexity in experiments validating the newly designed function. As same system might perform differently in different chassis and incorrect operation plus contamination might lead to entirely fail, an experiment should be repeated times to obtaining our ideal results. Our project aims at realizing the potential of computer function in guiding experiment after the design of synthetic biology. On one hand, our software can help the user choose existing synthetic devices more conveniently, or provide a platform for them to design their own parts, assembling their own synthetic system. On the other hand, based on selected synthetic systems, in order to decrease the mistakes, our software can supply a standard protocol, guiding the steps proceeding the validating experiment.
