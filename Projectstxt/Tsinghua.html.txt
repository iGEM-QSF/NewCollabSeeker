Genomic stability and DNA sequence fidelity are critical for normal cellular activities. If such storage center of genetic information is disrupted, detrimental consequences will take place, including but not limited to excessive cell death, abnormal proliferation, untimely cell senescence, etc. Therefore, a gene mutation surveillance system that can sensitively and efficiently detect and remove such aberrations in vivo is required.Saccharomyces cerevisiae is chosen as the model organism for designing such a gene surveillance system. As one of the most commonly used tools, it not only has a highly manipulatable genome, rapid growth speed, minimal pathogenicity, an ensemble of selectable markers, a well-defined genetic system, and most importantly, a highly versatile DNA transformation system.Essentially by designing such a system, a tool that can recognize aberrant mutation on mRNA sequences, or more generally at the transcriptomics level, is desired, because transcripts are derived from genomic sequences and hence are representatives of genomic instability and mutations. Surveillance Cas9 (suvCas9), termed for the first time by our team, is a variant of Cas9 without DNA cleavage activity and can target specific mRNA sequences by manually designed sgRNA and PAM sequences.That being said, after mutation is detected on mRNAs, how can our system respond? In a nutshell, when mutations occur, the surveillance system will detect and trigger the suicidal system. The surveillance system can be further quantitatively optimized to maximize its sensitivity and minimize potential side effects.
