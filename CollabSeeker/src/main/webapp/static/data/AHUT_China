 
Our team has chosen to continue our 2014 project of BIO-COMPASS after discussing its meaning and feasibility as well as comparing with other projects. Firstly, we firmly believe that the project of 2014 was quite potential and could be further researched and developed so as to bring more real benefits to human beings. Besides, our initial plan of using paclitaxel to cure diseases like cancer is not practical enoughï¼Œ thus needs to be further improved. Finally, our team is always ready for delving into a wonderful subject and pursuing the better or perfection, and continuing our 2014 project of BIO-COMPASS serves as a great option to achieve this purpose.Our project aims to build a new available bio-navigational system in which the map information will be coded in DNA strands with correlative biochemical reactions. The bio-navigational database builds up the relationship between biochemical operation instructions and traditional navigation instructions. In order to improve work efficiency, BIO-COMPASS 2.0 is designed to screen out and optimize the conditions of reaction according to road conditional filtering. Therefore, we attempt to renew the system based on our project in 2014 to adapt to the more complex path plans. As for this point, based on our previous pathway planning which includes design of sites and lines, we have further conducted deeper coding to lines. Also, the lines are used not only to complement corresponding nodes, but also encompass the information of length, node and specific identification. Through BIO-COMPASS 2.0, the shortest way to achieve the purpose of navigation will be obtained by using a variety of detection methods (such as electrophoresis , sequencing, etc).
