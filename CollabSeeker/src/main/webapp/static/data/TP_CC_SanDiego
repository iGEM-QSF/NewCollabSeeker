Fungal infections have detrimental impacts in agriculture by decreasing crop yields. Particularly, Fusarium wilt, a fungal disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum, affects a wide variety of foodstuffs. Current treatments for Fusarium wilt involve the cultivation of resistant crops; however, ever-evolving fungal pathogens can circumvent said resistances and induce blight within the resistant crop strains. As a result, an inherent component of all fungal cell walls, chitin, was targeted to combat fungal infections in plants.A diversely found glucose-derivative, chitin provides rigidity in all fungal species and also acts as a similar constituent of arthropod and insect exoskeletons and harder external tissues in various organisms. Our proposed mechanism for the antifungal treatment was to degrade chitin through the use of the enzyme chitinase. Various chitinase isozymes act upon the varying chitin structures in different organisms, so chitinase LbCHI31 was selected as the chitinase of choice for Fusarium oxysporum.
