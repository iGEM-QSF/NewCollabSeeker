Tumor cells compete with normal cells for all kinds of nutrition, and therefore can be considered as harmful mutants in the ecosystem in vivo. To effectively eliminate tumor cells, we propose to utilize microorganisms that share high ecological niche with tumor cells to deliver tumor-killing drugs to the tumor tissues. Through extensive literature search and correspondence with leading specialists, we decide to use Bifidobacterium Long, which has been proved to be non-immunogenic to human body and has the ability to preferentially settle in hypoxic regions, such as tissues with solid tumors. We plan to inject Bifidobacterium into tumor-bearing mice, and simulate the distribution and association of Bifido-bacterium with tumor cells using ecological competition models. 
We decide to use apoptin as the tumor-killing drug. Apoptin is a small molecular protein that induces apoptosis only in tumor cells but not in normal cells. To deliver apoptin, we will construct a recombinant plasmid, which consists of DNA replication origins and related genes from pMB-1, a bifidobacterial plasmid, and DNA replication origins from pUC18, a plasmid commonly used in E.coil. As a result, the plasmid can be amplified both in E.coil. and Bifidobacterium. Furthermore, we will clone HU, a Bifidobacterium promoter, and apoptin gene into this recombinant plasmid. After the tumor-killing ability of this recombinant plasmid is proven, we will focus on enhancing the biosafety of our system through regulating the expression of apoptin gene and applying a conditional lethal mechanism to restrict the proliferation of Bifidobacteriun.
