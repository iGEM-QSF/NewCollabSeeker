Inspired by Olivia Hallisey’s invention in 2015--Detection of Ebola via a Silk-Derived Lateral-Flow System and Mr. Keith Pardee’s article about Paper-Based Synthetic Gene Networks, initially, we had the idea of designing a test paper to contribute to virus detection via the method of synthetic biology. We’ve made research on several viruses, including Ebola, Zika and HIV, however, when later confronted with statistics revealing the high mortality rate of HCV and the great magnitude of its spreading, China included, we shifted our attention to the relatively neglected virus. Later, Mr. Keith Pardee and his lab published an article about the detection of Zika virus which was an extension of their previous program (Keith Pardee, 2016). The article has motivated us to apply Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA) to our project.
