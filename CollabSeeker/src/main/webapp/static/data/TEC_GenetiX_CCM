The idea of the project this year consists on the bioremediation in aqueous media of molecules that are similar to estrogen, such as BPA and phthalates that are common secondary products in the manufacture of many common plastics. We plan to use and/or improve one of the previous estrogen biosensors  developed by past iGEM teams and then use the production of human proteins TGB and TTR for the bioaccumulation of the toxic molecules.
