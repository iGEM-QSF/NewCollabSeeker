Considering superb conversion efficiency, environmental friendliness, and high energy capacity of hydrogen(H2), H2 has become a promising substitute for fossil fuels. Currently, H2 production is mainly rely on steam reformation which derive from hydrocarbons, coal gasification, and nuclear-powered water electrolysis. What has mentioned above, however, is not environmentally-friendly or unsustainable enough. When it comes to the biological method of H2 production, the original resources, sunlight energy, is inexhaustible and renewable. 

We focus our attention on Chlorella, a green algae, which can photolyze water to produce H2 using hydrogenase under anaerobic condition. However, this process only occurs within a transient time, last for a few minutes during darkâ€“light transition. Owing to the fact that the certain hydrogenase would lose its function when exposed to oxygen, cellular creates anaerobic conditions via respiration in darkness that can activate hydrogenase.

Another material that we take consideration into is the capsid from the bacteriophage P22. The P22 capsid is a particularly powerful platform that encapsulate of various products such as enzymes. It can create discrete spaces to localize certain chemical processes such as biohydrogen production by hydrogenase.
