Alzheimer is a disease prevailed in olds around the world and currently there hasn't have any effective treatment and the early diagnosis is hard to accomplish. Current research has already found that the fold change of specific kinds of microRNA has correlations with Alzheimer's development. To improve the method we can use widely to detect the disease,we are going to develop a rapid and simple diagnosis for Alzheimer disease using the different expression of microRNA between patients and healthy controls. A reporter carrier containing a repressed promoter is hoped to be constructed, which opening is controlled by microRNA degrading or inhibiting mRNA. The accuracy of the system will be increased by the synergistic effect of repressor proteins. Combined with reporter gene, a couple of microRNA would also be used to construct different plasmids to get efficient system which may can offer prototype for massive detection accurately and fast in a massive scale.
