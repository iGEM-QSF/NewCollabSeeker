Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been used to explore the potential to use it as an inexpensive and easily scalable system for the production of proteins. As the most widely used insect-resistant gene all around the world, the cry gene from B.thuringiensis(Bt) is one of the most efficient gene encodes a insecticidal crystal protein (ICP) with strong specific activity against only one or a few insect species. Based on the recent research in our school, we have been cloning a series of genes which could control the larvae of mosquito from natural B.thuringiensis(Bt).Considering the difficulties of colonization in the natural environment, especially around water, for traditional chassis biont,such as E.Coli and yeast, constructing genetic engineering Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with cry and cyt gene is a good way to keep the effect of toxic protein in natural environment.
