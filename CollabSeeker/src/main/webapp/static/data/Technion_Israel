We, the Technion iGEM team of 2016, are developing FlashLab - a user-friendly chip for rapid detection of various substances such as hormones and heavy metals. The detection relies on the E. coli chemotaxis system, which allows bacteria to move away from or towards target materials. In comparison to existing biosensors, this system is expected to combine simplicity, speed and universality - offering the ability to detect diverse materials using the same method without the need for expensive lab equipment. The idea is to use a bacterial chemoreceptor and exchange its ligand-binding domain (LBD) with a small library of various LBDs. This library will be based on (1) natural bacterial chemoreceptors and (2) novel LBDs; designed using the RosettaCommons software suite. Moreover, to expand the repertoire of LBDs we plan to use an innovative approach to introduce self-splicing inteins as triggers for chemotactic activity. To observe the bacteria, which co-express both the redesigned chemoreceptor and a color protein, several different designs of microchips will be tested. The bacteria will be confined to a microchannel and chemotactic movement, induced by the target material, will lead to the formation of clusters that are visible to the naked eye. Given the simplicity of the design, the chip is expected to work much like a home pregnancy test â€“ just insert a sample and wait for the answer!
