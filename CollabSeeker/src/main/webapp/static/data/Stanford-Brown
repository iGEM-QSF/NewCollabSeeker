The Stanford-Brown 2016 iGEM team is building biologically produced membranes and sensors for space exploration. Biological materials have a variety of advantages over traditional building materials; most significant for our purposes, they are light and self-replicating.  These characteristics make biomaterials ideally suited for space exploration.  One possible application for these materials would be a biosensing balloon, which could be sent up into both terrestrial and extraterrestrial atmospheres to detect both temperature and molecules of interest.  Furthermore, biomembranes and biosensors have many additional applications both on here on Earth and in space.
