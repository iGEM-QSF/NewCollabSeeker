TecCEM_HS 2016 team, initially recruited on March 2016, determined that the early detection of sexually transmitted diseases was of major importance given the broad range of consequences they have on public health. After some weeks of research and incidence analysis, the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) was selected because of the concern it has raised throughout Mexico. Nowadays, HPV is the most common cause of cervix cancer within the country. 


The virus has been characterised and documented at the genetic and proteomic levels, but given its pathophysiology during infection, diagnosis at early stages is somewhat complicated and unusual, particularly because of the absence of symptoms. Moreover, it is of crucial importance as some HPV strains have been shown to correlate with oncogenic outcomes. TecCEM_HS has decided to dedicate 2016 project to the development of a rapid test method by using the novelties of riboswitch technology. With careful and appropriate design, bacteria could serve as a signal provider that may give insight into the viral presence by means of fluorescence. The device would thereby provide a money-wise, quick, and reliable way of concluding upon Papilloma's infection, serving as an alert for further physician assessment.
