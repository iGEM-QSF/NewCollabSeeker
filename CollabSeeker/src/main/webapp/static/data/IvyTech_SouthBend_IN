Project Proposal (Draft): This year Team Ivy Tech is investigating environmental endocrine disruptors in the local water shed and the food supply.  We intend to build a new biosensor for estrogen and test for activity in the St. Joseph River Valley watershed and in Lake Michigan and screen for the constituents of soy that effect breast cancer proliferation. For biological read-out we will use estrogen-sensitive cells lines like the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7.
In addition, the most commonly prescribed drug is 17-beta estradiol and it is prevalent in human sewage and may be the largest contributing factor to the observed feminization of aquatic vertebrate species in the environment.  One approach to the inactivation of estrogen is the irradiation of sewage.  With our biosensor and estrogen-sensitive cell lines we will screen for the loss of estrogenic activity and/or the formation of unknown anti-estrogenic compounds.
Finally, the number and types of genes that are under the control of estrogen is uncertain.  We plan to use CRISPR to insert a RFP-generator cassette in genes under the control of an ERE in one of the two homologous chromosomes.  Gene-edited cells that respond to 17-beta estradiol or estrogenic/anti-estrogenic compounds that we isolate from the environment will cloned using our "Bio-CNC machine" (a modified 3D printer) with the eventual purpose of identifying the genes that are activated.
