To innovate a refrigerator without electricity, we invented a prototype of FRAVORATOR that is possible to preserve food by antibacterial volatiles synthesized by Escherichia coli. 

For high-efficiency synthetic processs, we tried two methods. 1, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate（DXP）synthase, Dxs, is down-regulated when its downstream material has been produced to some extent. So, we tried to over-express, another DXP synthase, nDXP, that rarely has been used in normal conditions. 2, Using genomic editing method, we tried to knock out synthase, that we
used to produce unnecessary by product.
