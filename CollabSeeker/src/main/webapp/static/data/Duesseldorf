The optogenetic induction of apoptosis in the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) should serve us as a model for the future application in cancer cells. The application of optogenetic switches enables us to induct extremely precise and multiply regulated killing of cells. Thereby this system will represent an improvement in comparison to conventional, less target-specific methods. The sequential utilization of two optogenetic switches, namely a phytochrome-based expression system and a LOV2-based switch needed for the localization of apoptotic proteins to the outer mitochondrial membrane, allows the attainment of a very high level of spatiotemporal specificity for apoptotic activation.
