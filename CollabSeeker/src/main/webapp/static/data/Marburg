
The iGEM team Marburg 2016 has decided to overcome the issue of landgrabbing by producing desired substrates through fermentation. This is achieved by establishing a modular system of artificial co-culture between different model organisms. Our novel approach allows us to engineer a system that benefits from the strengths of each strain to full extend. Therefore, bottlenecks in high-value substrate production can be overcome easily such that landgrabbing is replaced by fermentation methods. Currently we are engineering dependencies to stabilize the cell-cell-interactions well as implementing production pathways for our desired products.
    
Our Human Practices project aims to establish multidirectional communication channels between society, academia and industry as our advanced fermentation project has a high impact on all these fields. In order to draw industrial interests, we define our projectâ€™s main aspects in terms of economy and ecology. Also we want to find out how the public feels about products that have been produced by fermentation, which is also of high interest for industry as well as academia. But as the public may not always be familiar with the terms and the subject of fermentation and Synthetic Biology, we are additionally working on an easily accessible platform that provides knowledge, information and material to get an insight into the field of Synthetic Biology and Metabolic Engineering.
    
Following up on the killswitch statistics from the iGEM Team Marburg 2015, we want to extend the database by providing fully characterized kill switches to the iGEM community. This subproject will be carried out in collaboration with the iGEM Team Lethbridge. While we will provide modelling approaches they will implement and characterize identified killswitchs in the lab.
