Perfluorinated chemicals, PFCs, are hazardous man-made chemicals produced or used in water- resistant clothing (widely known as Gore-TexR) and semiconductor industry, which are harmful to our environment and potential carcinogen human.Due to there was no regulation for banning PFCs usage and emission (even in most countries all over the world nowadays), scientists have discoveredthe liquid and volatile PFCsâ€™ distribution in snow in the mountain, in the air, and even in drinking water.So, it is essential for us to develop an efficient and environmental-friendly method to deal with PFCs disaster before the evolution of the regulation, and most importantly to keep animal and human suffered from PFCs disaster. We want to engineered bacteria with carbon-fluorine bonds breaking enzyme- Fluoroacetate Dehalogenase to be more efficient, more sustainable, and to save our mother nature!
