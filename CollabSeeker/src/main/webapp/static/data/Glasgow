Vitamin deficiencies are a major problem across the globe, especially in developing countries. Hypovitaminosis A (deficiency in Vitamin A) is the primary cause of preventable blindness in children, whereas folate deficiency is linked to an increased rate of spina bifida. 
We hope to target these ailments by manipulating yogurt bacteria to produce beta-carotene and produce more  higher levels of folate. Our final goal is to introduce three genes in the beta-carotene synthesis pathway and upregulate the production of folate in a strain of lactic acid bacteria e.g. Streptococcus thermophilus. The yogurt produced from the bacteria would be rich in both beta-carotene (which is converted by the body into Vitamin A) and folate.
Alongside this, we also aim to characterise lactic acid bacteria in various ways in order to increase understanding and ability to work with these potentially useful organisms.
Additionally, we aim to make an accessible solar water bath incubator that could be used in developing countries to pasteurise milk and make yogurt. cessible solar water bath incubator that could be used in developing countries to pasteurise milk and make yogurt.
