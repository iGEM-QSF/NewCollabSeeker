 The extraordinary physical and functional properties of DNA and RNA have led to extensive investigation into their suitability for use in many fields including therapeutics, diagnostics, chemistry, nanotechnology, and molecular computation.
This year ATOMS_Turkiye team has decided to describe some properties and applications of nucleic acid enzymes. We think that our project will show a different side of applications of nucleic acid enzymes. We plan to introduce new nucleic acid-based sensors that in future can become fast, user-friendly and inexpensive.
