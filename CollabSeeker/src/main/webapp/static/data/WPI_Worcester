We are using CRISPR/dCas9-based RNA targeting and dCAS9 fusions to two different RNA editing enzymes, APOBEC and ADARs1, to make C->U or A->I (G) edits in an RNA target. Our technology will be reversible and tunable, and will increase the variety, efficiency and safety of gene editing technologies. We hope to be able to apply this technology through RNA therapeutics to cure diseases caused by nonsense and substitution mutations.Greetings all interested visitors, we are working on our project but are still in the preparatory stages. Because of this, we have not yet started on filling out our site. We will be sure to add more to our website in the near future.  Check out our Facebook!
