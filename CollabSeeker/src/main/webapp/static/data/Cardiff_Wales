Our project is focused on healthcare - from the initial meetings we played with multiple threads, which shared a common theme of using a novel biosensor, CRISPR/Cas9. Eventually the focus turned to sexual health, and the speed and methods of testing used.From here, the idea of a bioluminescent DNA assay, for improved and near immediate point of care testing of disease, came about. This would be via a CRISPR/Cas9 and split luciferase. Not only do we hope to achieve proof of concept (i.e that the luciferase can successfully recombine to noticably fluoresce), via our outreach contacts we aim to improve the public knowledge of GMO, and to inspire younger generations.
