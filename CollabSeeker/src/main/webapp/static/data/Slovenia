In the past years of iGEM and synthetic biology a lot of projects have been devoted to the development of synthetic genetic circuits and logic gates. Most of those were based on transcription regulation, however this mechanism is relatively slow and the final output can be detected only after several hours or days.
This year team Slovenia has decided to tackle the problem of the design of fast logic circuits. We plan to introduce new protein-based sensors that will allow cells to quickly respond to input signals such as light stimulation or chemical dimerizers and produce outputs that could potentially be used for therapeutic treatment.
